## Why Use UI Frameworks Like Bootstrap 5 Instead of Raw HTML and CSS?: 
After gaining experience with UI frameworks like Bootstrap, I realized the main difference between using pure CSS and Bootstrap lies in the number of steps required. Building a webpage can be compared to cooking a stew. If we think of HTML as the pot, then CSS is like preparing and chopping the ingredients yourself. Bootstrap, on the other hand, is like using pre-made, ready-to-cook ingredients. When building a webpage with raw HTML and CSS, you have to manually write all the <style> attributes. This involves coding the layout, spacing, typography, and responsiveness from scratch. In contrast, when building a webpage with Bootstrap, much of that work is already done for developers. We simply use pre-built components and classes to achieve professional results quickly.
In addition, UI frameworks like Bootstrap provide significant time-saving benefits for developers. Instead of writing complex CSS code for grids, margins, and responsive behavior, developers can utilize Bootstrap’s built-in classes and components. This results in a streamlined workflow, where creating a polished and consistent design takes fewer steps. Additionally, using a framework like Bootstrap ensures a clean and uniform look throughout a webpage with minimal effort, which is particularly helpful when working on large projects.

## Comparison of Web Pages Built With and Without a UI Framework:   
When I first began learning Bootstrap, I created two versions of a simple webpage: one using raw HTML and CSS, and the other using Bootstrap. The first webpage, built with only HTML and CSS, had basic typography and alignment. I had to manually set background, margins, and aligns.

The second version, built using Bootstrap, looked much more polished and professional, even though it required far less code.

By utilizing Bootstrap’s grid system and pre-designed components, I was able to create a well-structured and visually appealing webpage with minimal effort. This comparison highlights how much easier and more efficient it is to use a UI framework to achieve high-quality results.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, while coding standards and tools like ESLint significantly enhance code quality and ensure consistency, from my perspective, it’s crucial to go beyond these tools and be diligent in studying and reading code to gain a deeper understanding of programming language.
