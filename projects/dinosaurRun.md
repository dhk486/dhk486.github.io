Dinosaur Run is a simple console-based game I developed using several functions and ASCII art to practice C language. 

I made this code in C language to improve understanding C language I have learned in ICS 212.

<pre>
This Dinosaur Run is inspired by the Google Chrome Dino game where the player controls a dinosaur that must jump over obstacles (represented as trees). The game has the following mechanics:
  1. The dinosaur's position on the screen changes as it jumps and falls back due to gravity.
  2. The player presses the 'z' key to make the dinosaur jump.
  3. Trees (obstacles) move from the right side of the screen to the left.
  4. If the dinosaur collides with a tree, the game ends and displays a "Game Over" message along with the final score.
  5. The score increases as the dinosaur successfully avoids trees. 
  6. As the score increases, the game's speed increases, making it progressively harder.
