This project is a console-based game inspired by the Google Dinosaur game, developed in C. Players control a dinosaur that jumps to avoid oncoming trees. The game tracks the score and increases speed as the player progresses. I made this code in C language to improve understanding C language when I was learnig C in ICS 212. I am interested in creating game and C language is a major language when people create a game. I wanted to learn and practice how a simple game can be made in C language. I got resource of making a simple run game from YouTube.
